# Janggi-Game

Janggi is a Korean board game similar to chess. The objective of this game is to checkmate the opposing player's general game piece. A general is in check if it could be captured on the opposing player's next move. A player cannot make a move that puts or leaves their general in check. The game ends when one player checkmates the other's general.
This program is a recreation of Janggi and is played by two players.
